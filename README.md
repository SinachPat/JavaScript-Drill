## Introduction
You may just be getting started with JavaScript or you've been learning for some time now, this playground is for you to build your muscles. 
If you read about a JavaScript concept but can't solve a problem with it you have not really learnt it.

Do you believe in "use it or lose it" ? Then, it's time to make use of what you know.

About the piece:
JsDrill is as the name implies a heads down kept in problem solving using JavaScript.
It spans from beginner concepts to more advanced use of JavaScript.

We'll also pay attention to data structures and algorithms and do well to mention in our explainer articles.

We'll make weekly updates of at least 5 exercises to the whole repository spread across the various concepts.
We'll keep updating each concept with their respective exercises as we go through various resources.
